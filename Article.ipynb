    "# The Basics\n",
    "Let's cover the basic concepts first before we discuss practical applications. What are the key metrics that are in play, when we're investigating a queue? We have the following relevant metrics when talking about queues in general?\n",
    "\n",
    "![queue](docs/simple-queue.drawio.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Arrival rate:** The rate at which new work items arrive in the queue. \n",
    "- **Wait time:** The total time spent by each work item in the system. Usually composed of two elements. Time spent in the queue (determined by preceding work items) and time spent with service.\n",
    "- **Servers:** Refering to the level of paralellization.\n",
    "- **Service time:** The time required to process a single work item. It's often translated to rate and called **service rate**.\n",
    "- **Departure rate:** The rate at which items are processed.\n",
    "- **Utilization:** Simply describes the ratio between arrival and departure rate. \n",
    "\n",
    "### Matching with practical naming and notation\n",
    "In software engineering, we use slightly different terms when talking about performance. You can find a mapping between the notation used in queuing theory and their counterpart:\n",
    "| Naming in model  | Naming in software systems   | Description |\n",
    "| ---------------: | :--------------------------: | :---------- | \n",
    "| arrival rate/departure rate | throughput | Usually we don't distinguish between the two (although we should) and refer to them as throughput depending on the context. |\n",
    "| wait time | latency | None of them distinguishes between wait time in the queue and waiting because being served. |\n",
    "| servers | executors/processors | We mostly mean the number of CPUs/workers on that |\n",
    "| service time | execution time/duration | Measured as the time required to do a single task. Often just mixed with latency. |\n",
    "| utilization | utilization | Practically utilization is calculated with various methods. Often it means the ratio of unutilized CPU ticks and utilized ones over a given time window (e.g. 5 seconds). | \n",
